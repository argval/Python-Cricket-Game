Welcome to Cricket! (but in Python! üêçüèè)
How is Cricket played in the first place? Well here's a brief overview: 
A guy is batting, another guy is bowling, and there are fielders all around the field. 
The bowler bowls the ball, the batter hits the ball, and the fielders try to catch the ball. 
The batter can run between the wickets to score runs. The bowler tries to get the batter out. 
The batter tries to score as many runs as possible. The team with the most runs wins. Simple, right? üèè

But how do you represent this in Python? ü§î
Now that's a challenging question. Well here's the basic layout:
1. We create a coin toss in the beginning to decide who bats/bowls first.
2. Both the teams will have 6 players each.
3. This can be a multiplayer game or a single player game. In the case of a singleplayer game, the computer will play as the second team.
4. The game will have 3 overs in total.
5. Both the teams have a choice to choose between the numbers 1-6. The number chosen will be the runs scored.
6. What's the point of the bowling team choosing the numbers then? Well, the idea is, if the bowling team chooses the same number as the batting team, the batting team will be out.
7. The aim of the batting team is to score as many runs as possible. The aim of the bowling team is to get the batting team out as quickly as possible.
8. This game will be played in a turn-based format. The batting team will bat first, followed by the bowling team. So basically, two innings.
9. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.
